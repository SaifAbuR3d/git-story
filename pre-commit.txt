# '--check' flag "Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace errors."

#  the output of the line
#    $ git diff --check --cached                    will be something similar to :

#    chapter3.txt:8: trailing whitespace.
#    +a new line to test the hook.

# sed is a stream editor that process the text line by line:
# delete the lines begining with (+) or (-) operator
# and delete the number in the form :x: from the file path
# we left only with the file path

# process each unique file, the (sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' "$file") command removes trailing whitespaces from each line of the file.
# -i to overwrite changes to the file

# finally, stage the modified changes with (git add "$file")


git diff --check --cached | sed '/^[+-]/d' | sed -E 's/:[0-9]+:.*//' | uniq | while IFS= read -r file; do
    sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' "$file"
